    "It's a supervised machine learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to predict the value of a variable base on the value of another variable\n",
    "\n",
    "It shows the relationship etween 2 variables and how change in one variable impacts the other\n",

    "The variable you wanna predict is called the dependent variable\n",

    "## Types of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It considers one dependent variable(interval or ratio) and one independent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It considers one dependent variable and multiple independent variables\n",
    "\n",

    "## Linear Regression Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear relationship\n",
    "- Multivariate normality\n",
    "> It's a statistical concept that describes the distribution of multiple variables as being jointly normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "- No or little multicollinearity\n",
    "> It's a phenomenon that occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other\n",
    "> This makes it difficult to establish the effects of each variable on the dependent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- No auto-correlation\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity\n",
    "> Refers to the assumption that the variance of the residuals(the differences between observed and predicted values) is constant across all levels of the independent variables"
